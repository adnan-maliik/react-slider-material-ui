          In collaboration with ZOZOSUIT, our mirror will also provide a highly
          accurate replica of the userâ€™s body via scanning and image processing.
          Through this, we will also be able to provide motion tracking for the
          user-customized metahuman in real time, making the experience
          incredibly realistic provided the mirror will be touch screen and
          interactive.
